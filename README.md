#Qura'an Kerim

**Rule 1:**
Surah 1 is dua/supplication shouldn't/cannot be compiled *without* Surah 2. The two make the main body.
Then you can proceed further.

The main LaTeX package used here (You can see myquran00.tex for reference) is polyglossia.
Using the main.tex (or myquran00.tex) one can modify the document to output into a different language setup.  
1. Install font mequran.ttf. In addition for Amharic users find abyssinicaSIL on sil website or google search for it on the web or alternative fonts; <br/> 
2. Make sure you select the font of choice on main.tex (or myquran00.tex);<br/>
3. Run <it>xelatex main.tex </it> (or myquran00.tex) 

##OBJECTIVE

This is so that people can have their own offline use and is to decrease the use of Internet and its related current problems. One can write a facebook comment but cannot help himself write a single aya on his computer that he can later use. HUMANS ARE NOT KHALIDIN. They last.
